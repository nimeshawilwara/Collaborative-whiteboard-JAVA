# Collaborative-whiteboard-JAVA

Welcome to Collaborative Whiteboard, a Java-based project designed to facilitate real-time collaboration on a shared digital whiteboard. This project demonstrates my skills in Java programming and networking, providing a platform where multiple users can draw, write, and interact simultaneously.

How It Works

Server Setup: The server application initializes and listens for incoming client connections. Client Connection: Users run the client application to connect to the server and join the shared whiteboard. Collaboration: Users can draw on the whiteboard, and all changes are broadcast to all connected clients in real time. Synchronization: The server ensures that all clients have a synchronized view of the whiteboard.
